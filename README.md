# Quantum-Routing-System

Developed a Quantum-powered routing system for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The solution integrates classical optimization (Google OR-Tools) with quantum machine learning models (Qiskit, PennyLane) to generate optimized delivery routes. An interactive dashboard (Streamlit) enables users to input data, visualize routes, and compare classical vs. quantum predictions, making complex computations accessible and user-friendly.

Key Features:

Hybrid Optimization â†’ Combines classical OR-Tools solver with quantum optimization models

Quantum Integration â†’ Implemented with Qiskit & PennyLane for route prediction and learning

Interactive Dashboard â†’ Streamlit-based UI with dynamic graphs, charts, and route maps

Data Visualization â†’ Plotly/D3.js for analytics and Leaflet.js for geospatial mapping

Scalable Architecture â†’ Modular Python backend with API integration

Frontend (UI & Visualization):
Streamlit, React.js, Plotly, D3.js, Leaflet.js

Backend (Optimization & APIs):
Python, Google OR-Tools, NumPy, SciPy

Quantum Computing:
Qiskit, PennyLane, Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithms

Other Tools:
GitHub (version control), VS Code, Agile methodology

Skills Demonstrated:

Quantum computing & hybrid algorithms for optimization

Classical optimization techniques with Google OR-Tools

Full-stack development (frontend + backend integration)

Data visualization & geospatial mapping

Research-to-application transition (concept â†’ prototype â†’ demo)
